## Code Refactoring

The main request for this particular site was to refactor the code to optimize it for search engines.
<br>Alt attributes were added to each image to enhance this property.
<br>In addition, the code was made cleaner and more organized overall.

<br>The source code was improved with more descriptive semantic HTML elements.
<br>The CSS code as a whole was reordered in order to more closely mirror the HTML code.
<br>A concise, descriptive title was added, and the headers were reordered per best practice.
<br>Several comments can be found within the code itself noting the location and nature of the changes.
