# Challenge Module 1

## I was given a starter code to refactor based on a series of criteria. 

The user story was as follows: 
<br>AS A marketing agency
<br>I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
<br>SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

<br>The acceptance criteria was as follows:
<br>GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
<br>WHEN I view the source code
<br>THEN I find semantic HTML elements
<br>WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
<br>THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
<br>WHEN I view the image elements 
<br>THEN I find accessible alt attributes 
<br>WHEN I view the heading attributes 
<br>THEN they fall in sequential order 
<br>WHEN I view the title element
<br>THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## After a bit of work, I believe all the acceptance criteria have been accurately met.

The semantic HTML elements were broken up into a more appealing view for the eye.
<br>Alt attributes were added to all images. 
<br>The HTML elements were changed to present best practices, evidenced in the h4 tag in the footer.
<br>A clear and focused title was also added into the head element.
<br>In addition to meeting acceptance criteria, the code as a whole was reordered and streamlined per best practices.
